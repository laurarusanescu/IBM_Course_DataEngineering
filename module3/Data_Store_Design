# 🗄️ Designing a Data Store: Key Considerations

A **data store (or repository)** is a centralized location for collected, organized, and isolated data that supports business operations and analytics. It can take the form of databases, data warehouses, data lakes, or big data stores.

## 🔍 1. Core Design Considerations

### ✅ Type of Data
- **Structured** → Use **Relational Databases (RDBMS)** (e.g., MySQL, Oracle)
- **Semi-structured/Unstructured** → Use **Non-relational (NoSQL)**:
  - **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis)
  - **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB)
  - **Column Stores** (e.g., Cassandra)
  - **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j)

### 📊 Volume & Scale
- **Large-scale raw data** → Use **Data Lakes**
- **High-volume, high-velocity, varied data** → Use **Big Data Repositories** (distributed storage and processing)

### 🎯 Intended Use
- **Transactional Systems**:
  - High-speed read/write
  - High update frequency
- **Analytical Systems**:
  - Complex historical queries
  - Fast query response
  - May require denormalization

---

## 🧱 2. Storage Considerations

### 🚀 Performance
- **Throughput**: Speed of data read/write
- **Latency**: Time to access specific data

### 🌐 Availability
- No downtime
- Continuous access to data

### 🧬 Integrity
- Protection from:
  - Corruption
  - Data loss
  - External attacks

### ♻️ Recoverability
- Data can be restored after failures or disasters

---

## ⚙️ 3. Schema Design and Normalization

- **Normalization**:
  - Reduces redundancy
  - Efficient for **transactional systems**
- **Denormalization**:
  - Faster query performance
  - Better for **analytical systems**

- **Indexing & Partitioning**:
  - Crucial for improving read/write performance

---

## 🔐 4. Privacy, Security & Governance

A **secure data strategy** must be designed upfront—not added later.

### 🛡️ Key Elements:
- Access control
- Multi-zone encryption
- Monitoring & audit logging
- Regulatory compliance:
  - **GDPR**
  - **CCPA**
  - **HIPAA**

- Use controlled data flows and multi-layered data protection techniques.

| Aspect                | Design Consideration                                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Type             | Structured (RDBMS) vs Semi/Unstructured (NoSQL, Data Lakes)     |
| Volume & Scale        | Large-scale, high-velocity → Big Data or Data Lake              |
| Intended Use          | Transactional vs Analytical (impacts speed, normalization)      |
| Performance           | Throughput, latency, and indexing                               |
| Availability          | Must be always-on, fault-tolerant                               |
| Data Integrity        | Avoid data loss/corruption                                      |
| Recoverability        | Disaster recovery planning                                      |
| Security & Governance | Encryption, access control, regulatory compliance               |
