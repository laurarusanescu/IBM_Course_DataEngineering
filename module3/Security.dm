# 🔐 Enterprise-Level Data Platform Security

Enterprise data platforms must address **security at multiple levels** to protect data, systems, and operations. This includes **infrastructure**, **network**, **application**, and **data security**, all governed by the **CIA Triad**.

## 🧱 CIA Triad – Core of Information Security

| Principle         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Prevent unauthorized access to data and systems.                          |
| **Integrity**        | Ensure data is accurate, trustworthy, and untampered.                    |
| **Availability**     | Ensure authorized users have timely access to data and systems.          |

## 🔐 Four Levels of Enterprise Security

### 1️⃣ Physical Infrastructure Security
Protects **facilities and hardware** (especially in cloud environments).
- **Access control**: Authentication and surveillance at facility entry points.
- **Power redundancy**: Multiple feeds, UPS, and generators.
- **Environmental control**: HVAC, humidity control.
- **Disaster risk mitigation**:
  - Avoid flood/earthquake zones
  - Earthquake-resistant structures
  - Lightning protection and grounding systems

---

### 2️⃣ Network Security
Secures **interconnected systems and data in transit**.
- **Firewalls**: Prevent unauthorized external access.
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Restrict connections to verified, updated devices.
- **Network segmentation**: Isolate resources with Virtual LANs (VLANs).
- **Security protocols**: Secure data in transit (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems monitor for attacks.

---

### 3️⃣ Application Security
Ensures **apps are safe, responsive, and data-protective**.
- **Threat modeling**: Identify attack patterns and weaknesses early.
- **Secure design**: Mitigate risks in architecture.
- **Secure coding**: Prevent known vulnerabilities.
- **Security testing**: Identify issues before deployment.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Security
Protects **data at rest** and **data in transit**.

#### 🔒 Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication**: Verifies identity (passwords, biometrics, tokens).
- **Authorization**: Grants access based on roles and privileges.

#### 🗃️ Data at Rest
- Stored in databases, tapes, mobile devices, etc.
- Use **encryption** to prevent access if compromised.

#### 📡 Data in Transit
- Moving across systems or networks.
- Use encryption protocols:
  - **HTTPS**
  - **SSL**
  - **TLS**

## 📊 Enterprise Security Practices

### 📍 Security Monitoring & Intelligence
- Track and respond to violations in real time.
- Provide **audit trails**, **compliance reports**, and **alerts**.

### 🏢 Organizational Security Policy
An effective policy aligns **people**, **policies**, **processes**, **systems**, and **tools** to:
- Support business and IT objectives
- Proactively manage risk
- Ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Security must span **infrastructure to application** and **data lifecycle**.
- Implement the **CIA triad** across all layers.
- Design systems with **built-in** (not bolted-on) security.
- Proactive **monitoring and governance** is essential for enterprise resilience.
