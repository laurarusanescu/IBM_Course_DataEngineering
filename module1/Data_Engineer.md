# ðŸ”§ Scope of Data Engineering

## ðŸ“Œ What is Data Engineering?
- **Goal**: Ensure quality data is available for **fact-finding** and **data-driven decision-making**.
- **Focus**: Mechanics of **data flow, access, and availability**.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Responsibilities

### 1. **Collecting Data**
- Extract, integrate, and organize data from **disparate sources**.
- Build **tools, workflows, and scalable architectures** for:
  - Databases
  - Data warehouses
  - Data lakes

---

### 2. **Processing Data**
- Clean, transform, and prepare data for use.
- Build **ETL pipelines**.
- Implement **distributed systems** (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
- Ensure:
  - **Data quality & validation**
  - **Privacy & security**
  - **Performance & compliance**

---

### 3. **Storing Data**
- Architect data repositories for processed data.
- Ensure:
  - **Scalability**
  - **Compliance**
  - **Backup & recovery**
  - **Monitoring systems**

---

### 4. **Making Data Available**
- Create:
  - **APIs/services** for controlled data retrieval
  - **Interfaces/dashboards** for data access
- Enable **secure, rights-based access** to users.

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team-Based Practice
- **No single person** covers all skills.
- Requires diverse expertise:
  - **Architects**: Design data systems
  - **DB experts**: Optimize data stores
  - **Programmers**: Implement tools/systems

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools vs. In-House
- Teams can choose:
  - End-to-end custom solutions
  - **Pre-built tools/applications** (on-premise/cloud)

---

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- Data Engineering provides **robust & scalable** infrastructure for data use.
- Focused on **tools, technologies**, and **real-world data complexity**.
- Central to transforming raw data into **valuable, decision-ready assets**.
