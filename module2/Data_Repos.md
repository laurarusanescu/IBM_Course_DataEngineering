## 📌 What is a Data Repository?

A **data repository** is a centralized place where data is:
- Collected
- Organized
- Isolated

It supports **business operations**, **reporting**, and **data analysis**.  
It can include one or more **databases** and range in scale from small to massive infrastructures.

## 🧩 Types of Data Repositories

### 1. **Databases**

A **database** is a structured collection of data for:
- Input
- Storage
- Search and retrieval
- Modification

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is the software that:
- Creates and manages the database
- Allows querying, storing, updating, and extracting data

#### 🔹 Types of Databases:

| Type               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Relational (RDBMS)** | Data organized in **tables** (rows and columns) with **defined schema**. Uses **SQL**. Optimized for structured data and multi-table queries. |
| **Non-relational (NoSQL)** | Designed for **schema-less** or flexible formats. Suited for **big data**, **IoT**, and **social media**. Offers high speed and scalability. |

### 2. **Data Warehouses**

A **data warehouse** is a **centralized repository** that:
- Integrates data from multiple sources
- Prepares data for analytics and BI tools

#### 🔄 ETL Process:
- **Extract** data from various sources
- **Transform** it into a clean, usable format
- **Load** it into the warehouse

Related terms:
- **Data Marts** – smaller, focused subsets of data warehouses
- **Data Lakes** – more flexible, raw-data repositories (covered separately)

> Traditionally relational, but increasingly support **NoSQL** formats

### 3. **Big Data Stores**

These repositories are built for:
- **High-volume**, **high-velocity**, and **high-variety** data
- Use **distributed computing and storage** infrastructure

**Examples:**
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- Apache Cassandra
- Google Bigtable
- Amazon S3 (for data lake architectures)

## ✅ Importance of Data Repositories

- Isolate and organize enterprise data
- Improve **analytics accuracy**
- Enable efficient **data reporting**
- Support **data archiving** and long-term storage
- Facilitate **data governance** and compliance
