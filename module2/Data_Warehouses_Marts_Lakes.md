# 🗃️ Data Mining Repositories: Data Warehouses, Data Marts, and Data Lakes

---

## 📌 Purpose

All data mining repositories aim to:
- House data for **reporting**, **analysis**, and **insight generation**
- Differ in their **architecture**, **data types stored**, and **data access methods**

---

## 🏛️ Data Warehouse

### What It Is
- A **centralized repository** that integrates data from multiple sources.
- Serves as the **single source of truth**, storing **current and historical data**.
- Data is **cleansed, modeled, and structured** before loading → **analysis-ready**.

### Data Sources
- Traditionally: Relational data from **CRM**, **ERP**, **HR**, **Finance** systems.
- Modern warehouses may include **NoSQL** and **non-relational** sources.

### Architecture (Three-Tier)
1. **Bottom Tier** – Database servers (relational or non-relational)
2. **Middle Tier** – OLAP Server for multi-source processing and analysis
3. **Top Tier** – Front-end tools for querying, reporting, and visualization

### Cloud Data Warehousing Benefits
- Lower cost
- Unlimited storage & compute
- Pay-as-you-go scalability
- Fast disaster recovery

### When to Use
- When handling **large volumes of operational data** for **reporting and analytics**

### Popular Data Warehouses
- Teradata Enterprise Data Warehouse
- Oracle Exadata
- IBM Db2 Warehouse on Cloud
- IBM Netezza
- Amazon RedShift
- Google BigQuery
- Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub
- Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse

## 🧮 Data Mart

### What It Is
- A **subset** of a data warehouse tailored for a **specific function** or **user group** (e.g., sales, finance)
  
### Types
| Type          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Dependent** | Subset of enterprise data warehouse. Data already transformed. |
| **Independent** | Sourced from operational/external systems. Performs its own data transformation. |
| **Hybrid** | Combines data from warehouses, operational systems, and external data sources. |

### Purpose & Benefits
- Targeted access to **relevant data**
- **Faster query response** for specific users
- **Cost-effective** analytics
- **Secure** and **controlled access**

---

## 🌊 Data Lake

### What It Is
- Repository that stores **structured**, **semi-structured**, and **unstructured** data in **native format**
- Schema and transformation are **not required before loading**

### Key Features
- Stores raw data for **future undefined use cases**
- Data is still **classified, protected, and governed**
- Architecture is **technology-agnostic**

### Deployment Options
- **Cloud Object Storage**: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage
- **Distributed Systems**: Apache Hadoop
- **RDBMS & NoSQL**: For massive data volumes

### Benefits
- Store **all types of data** (e.g., JSON, XML, logs, PDFs, databases)
- **Massive scalability** (from TBs to PBs)
- Skip defining schema upfront → **faster ingestion**
- **Repurpose data** for multiple future use cases

### Major Providers
- Amazon, Cloudera, Google, IBM, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle, SAS, Snowflake, Teradata, Zaloni

## 🧠 Summary

| Repository    | Structured? | Semi/Unstructured? | Schema Before Load? | Optimized For |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Warehouse** | ✅ Yes       | 🚫 Limited          | ✅ Required           | Business reporting & analytics |
| **Mart**      | ✅ Yes       | 🚫 No               | ✅ Required           | Departmental analysis |
| **Lake**      | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes              | 🚫 Not required       | Exploratory & large-scale analytics |

Each repository supports data-driven decisions but must be selected based on **use case**, **data type**, and **infrastructure** requirements.
